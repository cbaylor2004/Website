    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I have lived in Fort Branch, Indiana for the past 8 years. I live with my mom Anita, my dad John, and my brother Jt. 
    During those 8 years I have taken up band, tennis, student council, sunshine, and beta club. I work at R'z cafe as a busser part time for the past 4 years. I also just started real coding this school year.</p>
    <h3>Plans in the future</h3>
    <p>Ater I graduate high school I am planning to go to Ivy Tech for to do my general education and then transfer over to Missouri Southern State University.
        I am planning to take classes to get an education in Digital Forensics for the future. 
        Hopefully landing a job either at a company that need me, at a police station, or even at the FBI.</p>
